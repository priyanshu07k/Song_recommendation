Music Recommender Systems
Overview
This repository contains two distinct approaches for music recommendation:

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Music Recommender: A recommendation system based on the k-NN algorithm, which suggests songs to a user by analyzing the listening habits of similar users.
Content-Based Music Recommender: A recommendation system that recommends songs based on textual similarity in song descriptions (such as song lyrics or metadata).
Both systems rely on the Song_data.csv file for input data, which contains user and song interaction details.

Dataset
Song_data.csv: This file contains data used by both recommendation systems, including the following columns:
user_id: A unique identifier for each user.
song_id: A unique identifier for each song.
frequency: The number of times a user has listened to a song.
song: The title of the song (used in the content-based recommender).
text: Description or lyrics of the song (used in the content-based recommender).
Project Files
KNN Music Recommender (KNN_music_recommender.ipynb):

Implements the k-NN based recommendation system.
Recommends songs based on the listening habits of users with similar preferences.
Content-Based Music Recommender (Content_based_recommender.ipynb):

Implements the content-based recommendation system.
Suggests songs based on textual similarity in song descriptions or lyrics.
Installation
To run the project, you need to install the following Python libraries. You can install them using pip:

pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Ensure these libraries are installed in your environment before running the notebooks.

Usage
Open the desired Jupyter notebook (KNN_music_recommender.ipynb or Content_based_recommender.ipynb).
Ensure that Song_data.csv is placed in the same directory as the notebook.
Run all cells in the notebook to see the recommendation system in action.
Future Work
Future enhancements for this project may include:

Improving the accuracy of the k-NN system by incorporating additional user features.
Enhancing the content-based recommender by using more advanced natural language processing techniques for song description analysis.
Exploring hybrid recommendation systems combining both k-NN and content-based methods for better performance.
Acknowledgments
The original Song_data.csv dataset is crucial for both the recommendation systems.
The project leverages the following libraries:
pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and analysis.
